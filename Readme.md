# Build an MVC style app without an MVC specific framework or library.

## Learning Objectives

- Continue to build a strong foundation of JavaScript principles
- Continue to understand how ES6 modules work
- Continue to grok the concepts of Constructors & Prototypes & Class Syntax
- Begin to understand how the MVC pattern works

### Description

Build a small list like application without using any frameworks. It will be a "Contacts List App" where you can add your friends and acquaintances to a list and see all of their information.

### Normal Mode

Each Contact should have:

Full Name (first, last)
Photo (grab a URL from randomuser.me if you'd like)
Phone Number
City, State
Directions:

Your app should have at least 1 Model and 1 Controller. (2 separate classes)
As long as you have an index.html file then you have a View.
I should be able to add a contact to the list
I should be able to remove a contact from that list
Writes Tests for each class
In an effort to not make this assignment too long, write 1 Unit test per JavaScript class that you create

### Hard Mode

Make the data persistent (we will cover this in class on Wednesday)
